# APCS-Midterm-Project
this is a project I made for my APCS Midterm using basic python programming

On the main page, it is running 3 files, importing their functions from the files. It also import random.

This is a computer game with games inside; 3 to be specific. The imported random module is used for if the user wants the computer to pick a game randomly. However, if they don't, the imported functions are imported from 3 different files and the user can pick from those 3. I also used a for loop to introduce them and used an if-else statement to call each function.

The first function is calling a magic 8 ball game, using a simple for loop, list, and the import module. 

The second game is a dice game, using 2 random modules at the same time and printing them.

the final game is a text-to-binary code. this required the work of a dictionary with the keys being letters and the values being the binary code for that specifc letter. However, when using the for loop, you have to call the dictionary first, then call the word you want to change because if reversed, it will go in abc order, not your word order.
